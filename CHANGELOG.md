## [0.4.0] - 2017-10-17

Major refactor of the front-end application.

### Upgrade Notes
Due to the changes made to the install script, this release restricts the installed framework version to `v2.x.x` to avoid unsupported breaking changes introduced in framework `v3`.

There are a few notable changes to the code that may impact customisations:
- `app:dataReady` has been renamed to `origin:dataReady`
- `variables.less` has been renamed to `colours.less`.
- Some editor collections have been renamed:
    - `componentTypes` -> `componenttypes`
    - `extensionTypes` -> `extensiontypes`
    - `courseAssets` -> `courseassets`

Please check the release notes below for more information.

### Added
- Framework themes can now display a preview in the theme picker. To enable this, a `preview.jpg` file is needed in the theme folder root
- Can now specify custom auth source for MongoDB ([\#1673](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1673))
- New `contentPane` module takes over view rendering from `Router`, and acts as a consistent container for main app content. Makes sure scrolling is consistent across the application among other things.
- EditorDataLoader has been added to preload editor data. You can use the `EditorDataLoader.waitForLoad` function to halt code until preload has finished. You can also use the `editor:dataPreloaded` event.

### Changed
- Major refactoring of the frontend folder:
    - 'Core' code separated into modules, and core
    - Web-app loading rewritten
    - Core LESS files are now accessible without needing to specify a relative file path. `variables.less` has been renamed to `colours.less`.
    - All duplicate LESS files have been merged, and put in their respective module folder
    - The `adaptbuilder` folder has been renamed to `build`
    - Editor routing code has been simplified, and moved into the sub-module folders. See [modules/editor/index.js#L27-L55](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/blob/v0.4.0/frontend/src/modules/editor/index.js#L27-L55) for the routing code, and [modules/editor/article/index.js#L10](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/blob/release-0.4.0/frontend/src/modules/editor/article/index.js#L10) as an example of the new routing method.
    - Events using `app:` replaced with `origin:` for consistency. Most notably: any code using `app:dataReady` will need to be switched over to listen to `origin:dataReady`
    - Router has been refactored, and the following convenience functions added: `navigateTo` - wrapper for `Backbone.Router.navigate`, `navigateToLogin`, `setHomeRoute` and `navigateToHome`
    - Editor collections have been renamed to reflect the MongoDB collection names: `editor.componentTypes` -> `editor.componenttypes`, `editor.extensionTypes` -> `editor.extensiontypes`, `editor.courseAssets` -> `editor.courseassets`
    - `window.polyglot` has been abstracted into the new localisation module, which can be referenced with `Origin.l10n`
- Dashboard module has been renamed to projects, and is the default home route
- User management has moved from plugins to modules
- Install/upgrade scripts overhauled:
    - Can now upgrade the server and framework to specific releases
    - Can now upgrade the server and framework separately
    - Install/upgrade scripts have been made prettier to look at (and more useful) with the introduction of activity spinners, and more helpful log messages
    - Upgrade script now ignores draft and prereleases ([\#1723](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1723))
    - Upgrade/install script now allows custom git repositories to be used for both the server and framework source
    - Framework version can be restricted so as not to automatically upgrade to a version you don't want to support. To enable this, specify the `framework` version in `package.json` (accepts any valid semver range) ([\#1703](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1703))
- Besides the schemas, the user interface is now completely localised ([\#1573](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1573))
- Improved multi-user support for previewing/publishing of courses ([\#1220](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1220))
- User profile page is now correctly styled ([\#1413](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1413))
- Newly created courses can now be built without any editing ([\#1678](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1678))
- Must now input super admin password twice during install to avoid user error ([\#1032][https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1032])
- Abstracted polyglot into the new internal `l10n` library (accessible globally via the `Origin` object). Language strings are now obtained using `Origin.l10n.t`
- Backbone forms version updated, and override code tidied up/removed where possible
- Boolean selects are now rendered as checkboxes.

### Removed
- **Vagrant support has been dropped** ([\#1503](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1503))
- The user management's user list sort is now case-insensitive ([\#1549](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1549))
- Front-end tests removed for now

### Fixed
- Framework plugin update has been fixed ([\#1415](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1415))
- Unused user password reset data is now cleared on delete of the related user ([\#1553](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1553))
- Copy and paste now correctly includes any extension settings ([\#1484](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1484))
- Dashboard no longer hangs if large images have been used as hero images ([\#1470](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1470))
- Server plugin schemas now correctly reflect the latest state after a plugin has been updated (previously a server restart was needed for any schema changes to be reflected) ([\#1524](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1524))
- Preview loading route added to prevent preview opening in a background tab/window ([\#1636](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1636))
- We now only attempt to load valid routes, avoiding unnecessary server breakdowns ([\#1534](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1534))
- Mocha tests fixed, and integrated with TravisCI
- Dragging is now restricted for components depending on layout ([\#1631](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues/1631))
