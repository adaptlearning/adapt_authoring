# Kineo Adapt Authoring Tool

This is a fork of the open-source Adapt authoring tool, and is used by Kineo as a pre-release testing base for features prior to pushing to the open-source repository.

## Features

See [this wiki page](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt_authoring/wiki/Custom-features) for the list of differences between this fork and the open-source product.

## Installation

The steps to install are the same as those for the open-source product. Please consult [their wiki](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-the-Authoring-Tool) for more details.

## Reporting bugs

The code in this repository is not intended for the general public, and as such, we can't provide technical support to those that choose to use it.

If you find a bug, the best place to report it is on the [open-source issues page](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/issues) (please check that the bug is relevant to that product first!).
