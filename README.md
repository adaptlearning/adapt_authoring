##Versions

We are working towards the following goals and timelines:

We are aiming to produce version 0.1 of the Adapt authoring tool within Q4 2014. We expect this release will be minimal and still require end users to have access to developers. Our intention with this release is to start using it in production and gather a user community of early adopters, who are also able to help guide us along to version 1.0 via a number of interim releases.
Version 1.0 of the Adapt authoring tool will be the first official release aimed at non-technical end users.
